> not good enough for usage, see [todo](todo) for missing features

A ranger-fm inspired TUI file manager. Still very much in progress. Some of the features are:
- highly configurable, with configuration in Lua
- fast enough
    - performance improvements are only when needed - will not be blazing fast but difference from other file managers should not be noticeable
